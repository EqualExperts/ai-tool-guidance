NOTE - Don't forget to attach the detail report!

I'm writing a comprehensive report on AI tool analysis for [name] - [url]

The purpose of this report is to gather facts. It will be used by UK government policy makers, security analysts and architects to determine if the tool is suitable for UK government adoption, so it's very important we get the details correct and report facts accurately.

All sources must be well cited with up to date links and relevant information.  Ensure all information is current.  Use British english and a professional, but approachable tone. Use GOV.UK content standards.  The final document should be in the format of a single, downloadable markdown file.  The report should be concise, but still maintain the relevant detail.

The report must have the following sections:

# [Tool Name]

## 1. Tool Overview
[A short description of what the tool is, website, intended use, etc.]

## 2. Privacy Settings
[Any settings or setup in the tool to ensure privacy is maintained. Include links]

## 3. Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
[Links to the policies and any commentary that's useful]

## 4. Data Management

### 4.1 Server Location and Data Residency
[Where are the data centers and in what jurisdictions, include any restrictions on use for UK Government]

### 4.2 Data in Transit
[How data will it travel - what encryption is in place, include any restrictions on use for UK Government]

### 4.3 Data at Rest
[If data is stored in the data centers, then how data is stored and in what state, include any restrictions on use for UK Government]

### 4.4. Data Retention
[Data retention practices and policies. Defined by plan/tier, if applicable]

## 5. Audit Logging
[Any relevant audit logging features of the tool]

## 6. Access Controls
[Where relevant, anything to do with user accounts and privileges, example: not allowing Cursor directly commit to git]

## 7. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
[List of what standards the provider says they are compliant with]

## 8. References
